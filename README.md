My second webbshop I started on, to implement better logic and more AJAX-request to spare on the load-time and user experience.

Built it with the web-framework Spring MVC in Java.
The database layer I specified so that it can be implemented by anything, and not just a few single stuff. So instead of writing new SQL you can just add one project to handle customized database-calls.
And a model-layer to work with the project.

It isn't finished. I would say it is barely started on, but the way I wanted to do it with better logic (then my first webbshop), and AJAX-calls and so on - are all there.
This project is to show how to use the logic and loading of information - and how to use it good.
